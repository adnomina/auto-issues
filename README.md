# Auto Issues

> The issue tracker for you AI coding agent.

Auto Issues consists of a Fastify server that exposes endpoints for managing issues in an Sqlite3 database, as well as an [agent skill](https://agentskills.io/home) that explains how to use the API to your AI agent.

This project was inspired by
[Hyaxia/local_places](https://github.com/Hyaxia/local_places/).
